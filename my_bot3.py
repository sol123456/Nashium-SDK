Nashium Bot Template
====================

Welcome! This is your bot file. Your goal is to PREDICT what your opponent
will play (Heads=0 or Tails=1) in a matching pennies game.

HOW THE GAME WORKS:
-------------------
- Each round, both you and your opponent choose either 0 (Heads) or 1 (Tails)
- If you MATCH your opponent's choice, YOU WIN that round
- If you DON'T match, your opponent wins
- You play 10,000 rounds per match
- To qualify, you need to win >51.55% of rounds (statistically significant)

WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO:
------------------------
In the `move()` method, you receive a `state` object with:

    state.round_index       - Current round number (0 to 9,999)
    state.my_history        - Tuple of YOUR past moves, e.g., (0, 1, 1, 0, ...)
    state.opponent_history  - Tuple of OPPONENT'S past moves

RULES:
------
1. Your bot MUST be deterministic given the same seed
2. You have 100 seconds TOTAL for all 10,000 moves (not per move!)
3. You must return either 0 or 1 from move()
4. Don't use external resources (network, files, etc.)

TIPS:
-----
- Look for patterns in state.opponent_history
- Simple strategies often beat complex ones
- Test locally with: nashium qualify my_bot.py
- Check determinism with: nashium check my_bot.py

EXAMPLE PATTERNS TO DETECT:
---------------------------
- Does opponent always play the same thing?
- Does opponent alternate?
- Does opponent copy your last move?
- Does opponent play the opposite of your last move?
